## Choose Your Own Adventure

> After spending an hour or two working on your CYOA, what has been your biggest challenge so far?

My biggest challenge so far is figuring out how to format the code so that it could work out the same way as how I thought out in my head. 

> What's one thing you learned about variables, so far?

You can ask users for their information and store it inside a variable using `input()`. Then you can use that variable for  future questions/choices to customize the user's experience.

> What's one thing you learned about conditionals, so far?

You can have many choices using `elif` and you can also nest conditionals within conditionals. 

## Closing Questions

> What emoji best describes how you feel in this class this week? Explain why you chose this one.

😁 because I wrote a lot of code for my CYOA and it works!
