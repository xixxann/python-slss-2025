## Python and Pygame

> So, what do you think about Pygame? What thoughts do you have?

I think that Pygame is an interesting software to use. It is nice creating visuals and writing code to determine how each sprite will move. 

## First Week Back and Two Weeks Left

> How did you feel this week about the transition from holidays back to school?

The transition was slightly rough as I had to catch up on the content I learned from my classes and remember if there any assessments the first week back.

> What was your biggest challenge this week?

My biggest challenge this week is remembering the content that I learned before break, especially when I had a test on Thursday for one of my classes.
