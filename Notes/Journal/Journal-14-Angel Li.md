## Cookie Algorithm

All credit goes to Alton Brown, one of the OG food scientists. This is his [recipe](https://altonbrown.com/wprm_print/the-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookie), adapted by me.
### Equipment

* Kitchen scale
* Mixing bowls
* Stand Mixer (this is optional but will help)
* [Mixing paddle](https://www.oxo.com/oxo-gg-wooden-saute-paddle.html) if you're doing this manually
* Baking pan (to chill cookie balls)
* Parchment paper

### Software
    16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter
    12 ounces bread flour
    1 teaspoon kosher salt
    1 teaspoon baking soda
    2 ounces granulated sugar
    8 ounces light brown sugar
    1 large egg
    1 large egg yolk
    2 tablespoons whole milk
    1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 

### Algorithm

1. Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat. Set aside to cool slightly.

2. Sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda onto a paper plate. Sifting is optional but will help thoroughly incorporate everything.

3. Pour the butter into the bowl of your stand mixer. Add the sugars and beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed for 2 minutes.

4. Meanwhile in a separate bowl, whisk together the whole egg, egg yolk, milk, and vanilla extract.

5. Slow the mixer to "stir" and slowly work the egg mixture into the butter and sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. If you're using your own muscles, use a sturdy paddle or spatula to mix everything thoroughly.

6. Using the paper plate as a slide, gradually integrate the dry ingredients, stopping a few times to scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Once the flour is worked in, add the chocolate chips. Semi-sweet or dark are best. If you're feeling extra spicy, M&Ms work.

7. Ball the dough. 1 1/2-ounce portions will give big cookies. 1 ounce is a pretty good size. Use your judgment. Place in a pan. Cover with plastic wrap. **Chill the dough for at least 2 hours.**

8. Heat oven to 350F. Racks on the bottom 1/3 and 2/3. Put chilled cookie balls on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. 6 cookies per sheet.

9. Bake two sheets at a time for 15 minutes, rotating pans halfway through baking. Rotations are optional but will help cooke everything evenly. When you bake your first batch, 15 minutes is a guideline. Adjust your times accordingly. 

10. Remove from the oven, slide the parchment with the cookies onto a cooling rack, and wait at least 5 minutes before devouring.
