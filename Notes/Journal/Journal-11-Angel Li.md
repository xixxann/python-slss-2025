## Linear Search

> Hidden in one house is a treasure. Using human language, describe how you would use linear search to find the treasure. To help, try making a numbered, step-by-step procedure.

Starting from the top right, I would go down the map.

1) I would go to the candy house.
2) I would go to the castle and then the tall house.
3) I would go to the boot house, big house (with the treasure), and the boat house.

When I find the treasure in the house, I stop searching.
