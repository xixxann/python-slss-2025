## Oh, we're halfway there...

> We're halfway through the semester. What thoughts do you have about programming so far?

It's been interesting and cool learning more on how to code and the different ways to structure it. Using trial-and-error for activities helped me learn more about its syntax.

> What are some challenges that you've experienced?

It was challenging in the beginning to do the recursion activity as formatting the code in a way for it to function the way I want it to took a while to figure out.

> What are some cool things that you've done?

I drew trees of different kinds asymetrically and symetrically. I was also able to write different codes to perform the same function of drawing a flower.

> In the remainder of the course, we'll look at Object Oriented Programming, communicating with APIs, and explore a little bit of game design. Are there any other ideas related to programming/computer science that you want to explore?

Website designing

> Are you a better typer?

Yes, better than before.

> Thank you!
