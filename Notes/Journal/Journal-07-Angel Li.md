## Recursion

***Please use your brain for these, no LLMs. I'm not looking for right answers, just your answers.***

> There are two things that you need to make a recursive function.
> What are those two things?

A function and a base (terminating) case.

This is because the term (TTP) is used in defining the term.

> Consider the function below. How many times will it call itself not including the initial function call?
> (It's poorly documented on purpose.)

```python
def some_recursive_function(int):
	if num > 1:
		return num + some_recursive_function(num-1)
	else:
		return 0

result = some_recursive_function(10)
```

It is called 9 times.
